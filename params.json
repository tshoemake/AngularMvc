  "body": "### Project Info\r\nThis project was created in an attempt to develop projects with technologies not used in my day-to-day work. I made this project while streaming on twitch.tv and gained many views and made lots of new connections as an unintentional, yet delightful result. This project is a small, simple app demonstrating basic AngularJS features including service calls.  It also uses an MVC Web API to handle those service requests and a combination of Dapper/EF6 to grab the data on the backend.
